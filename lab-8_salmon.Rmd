#Overall, does it look like describing the relationship between year and fresh salmon imports using linear regression makes sense? - YES

#Do you have any concerns about using linear regression to describe the relationship? - CLEAR DIPS IN LINEAR DATA TREND

#Linear Regression in R

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)
salmon_model

#y = β0 + β1x + ε
#Imports(tons) = -14982940 + ?(7550)

#???????? Where is the slope here? Is it -14982940? Is the intercept the year at 7550? What is the 25 (from the example in this case?)

# What does the slope mean in the context of this model?
#It's massive and doesn't make sense?

#What does the y-intercept mean in the context of this model? Why is that concerning? 
#Super far is the future and doesn't make sense? 

#What does this mean about extrapolating this model for past values?
#Don't do it because it all is confusing 

```

```{r}

plot(salmon_model)

#Do residuals appear normally distributed? - Some more than others, need to understand the specifics behind how they work more 
#Any concerns about heteroscedasticity or outliers? - Yes fo sho concerns, residuals are looking funky
