#Overall, does it look like describing the relationship between year and fresh salmon imports using linear regression makes sense? - YES

#Do you have any concerns about using linear regression to describe the relationship? - CLEAR DIPS IN LINEAR DATA TREND

#Linear Regression in R

salmon_model <- lm(salmon_fresh ~ year, data = salmon)
salmon_model

#y = β0 + β1x + ε
#Imports(tons) = -14982940 + ?(7550)

#???????? Where is the slope here? Is it 7550? Is the intercept the year at -14982940? What is the 25 (from the example in this case?)

# What does the slope mean in the context of this model?
#It's massive and doesn't make sense?

#What does the y-intercept mean in the context of this model? Why is that concerning? 
#Super far is the future and doesn't make sense? 

#What does this mean about extrapolating this model for past values?
#Don't do it because it all is confusing 

```

```{r}

plot(salmon_model)

#Do residuals appear normally distributed? - Some more than others, need to understand the specifics behind how they work more. The square root on looks good but not the "residuals" one 

#Any concerns about heteroscedasticity or outliers? - Yes fo sho concerns, residuals are looking funky, Cooks distance is something to look at...

#Explore model fit and significance

summary(salmon_model)

#Does year significantly predict salmon imports?
#Yes because p-value: < 2.2e-16 ??

#What does the R2 value actually mean in words?
#Multiple R-squared:  0.9478
#94.8% of variance in salmon imports is explained by year

#What proportion of the variance in salmon imports is NOT explained by year?
#100 - 94.8 = ? Is that right?
#Residual standard error: 14860 on 26 degrees of freedom - does error come into play here?
